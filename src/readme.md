# CloudOLight

CloudOLight is the control software for a dress filled with amorphous clouds of light. The lighting pattern is controlled wirelessly via OSC messages. Two OSC endpoints control the colours and intensity of LEDs at the top and bottom of an LED array. The dress automatically interpolates everything else.
